* When prompted for the length of the password, I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
* When asked for character types to include in the password, I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
* When I answer each prompt, my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
